Spring-93

Spring-93 Algorithm:

Former Algorithm:

Save ones: (2 ** 5)-1 after (2 **4 )-1. We need to count long Between ones.
We need to save from 1111 to 0001 it should be opposed.

By this alogrithm we can compress very many information to 22 Bytes or biger or smaller.

This algorithm use compress random files and .paq.
