Spring-93

Spring-93 Algorithm:

Former Algorithm:

Save zeroes: (2 ** 5)-1 after (2 **4 )-1. We need to count long Between zeroes after former equal long of zeroes and 1 or 0.

By this alogrithm we can compress very many information to 22 Bytes or bigger or smaller.

This algorithm use compress random files and .paq.
