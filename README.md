Spring-93

Spring-93 Algorithm:


We need to add "10" at start one time after add at the start every time "11", we need to divide by two and add of the % 1 or 0 after "10" and save what we have got after division by two. We use Reverso. Because we use numbers all zero will delete that mean we can compress.
